## Technologies decision

I choose React because is more simple, lightweight and allows to create applications more faster than Angular, I also decided to use React because unlike Angular, I have used it less, and this allows me to reinforce my knowledge.

## Improvements in my submission

The project can be solved quickly if only two components are created, one the list of missions and another with the information of the mission. But my own subconscious does not allow to do it that way, since the frontend is much more than that.

It is about making UI that have a good UX, and that look beautiful, that the app is easy to maintain, and structure the project in the most organized way. A good frontend in addition to good code, requires good UI.

That is why I takes additional time in the selection of colors, the interaction with the elements, giving feedback to the user about the status of the app (API Request), responsive design, making the elements look beautiful, among other small details.

## If I had more time

I would focus on unit tests since although I started developing following this pattern, I had problems as I progressed, which worries me since it was a requirement. And since I don't have much experience with them, I decided to make up for it with a good UX / UI design which is the part where I have a lot of experience.

`I already started learning more about the tests :D`
